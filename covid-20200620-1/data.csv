"WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing yesterday, highlighted that"
"today is World Refugee Day and highlighted the risks of COVID-19 for some of the world’s most"
"vulnerable people. He also stressed the shared duty to do everything we can to prevent, detect"
"and respond to transmission of COVID-19 among refugee populations."
"WHO has published ‘Criteria for releasing COVID-19 patients from isolation’ which provides an"
"update to previous guidance. The updated criteria reflect recent findings that patients whose"
"symptoms have resolved may still test positive for the COVID-19 virus for many weeks. Despite"
"this positive test result, these patients are not likely to be infectious and therefore are unlikely"
"to be able to transmit the virus to another person."
"WHO has published an Emergency Global Supply Chain System (COVID-19) catalogue. This"
"catalogue lists all medical devices, including personal protective equipment, medical"
"equipment, medical consumables, single use devices, laboratory and test-related devices that"
"may be requested through the COVID-19 Supply Portal."
